# ModSim-Celluler-Automata
Heat Diffusion Simulation Tool made with React.js and Material-UI Library

# How to Operate ?
- You can interect with the grid by selecting the each cell
- Set the boundary temperature, intermediate temperature and cell temperature(Selected cell will have this temerature)
- Now select the which type of cell you want to select 
  - after selecting `plot` it will choose the cell for ploting the simulation value for that cell
  - after selecting `Temperature` it will set the cell temprature equal to chosen in  cell temperature seekbar
- You can enable weighted propogation filter, set your customised values
- You can switch between different types of boundary conditions
- Reset Button will reset the plate according to your preferences of boundary conditions and cell temperatures
- Clear Selections will erase your prefereces
- Use Plot graph to plot the graph for selected grid points, dont forget to clear plot before the next simulation
- Hit Start Button, and visualize different types of simulation according to your preferences
- (Radar Shows Browser Lag because of simultaneously changing grid frames)
